### MCP Setup
- To run the MCP servers, you need to set up the following configurations in your `mcp.json` file. This file should be placed in the `.amazonq` directory of your project.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": 
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
    "supabase": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres"]
    },
    "Framelink Figma MCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=your-figma-api-key", "--stdio"]
    },
    "mcp-atlassian": {
      "command": "docker",
      "timeout": 60000,
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "CONFLUENCE_URL",
        "-e",
        "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME",
        "-e",
        "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_URL",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_USERNAME",
        "-e",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CONFLUENCE_URL": "https://your-confluence-instance.atlassian.net",
        "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME": "your-confluence-email",
        "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN": "your-confluence-api-token",
        "JIRA_URL": "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net", 
        "JIRA_USERNAME": "your-jira-email",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-jira-api-token"      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Make sure to follow the guide to setup for Jira & Figma credentials:

**Jira**: https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian

**Figma**: https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP
  

### Document Template
- The document templates for Confluenece documents / Jira tickets are located in the `.amazonq/templates` directory. You can customize these templates to fit your project requirements.

### Running the Demo Project
- To run the demo project, you need to have the MCP servers set up as described above. Once the MCP servers are running, you can execute the workflows using the AmazonQ IDE or the command line interface.

## Current Demo App Details & Setup Guide

   supabase db reset
   ```

4. **Copy environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials from `supabase status`

5. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
