# ðŸ”– [Feature] Create Registration Form Matching Figma Design

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
Implement a user registration form that exactly matches the provided Figma design for the to-do list web app. The form should include proper styling, icons, validation, and integration with the existing Supabase authentication system.

---

## ðŸ§© Background / Context
