# Feature Implementation Specification: Registration Form with Figma Design

## Introduction/Overview

Implement a user registration form at `/register` route that exactly matches the provided Figma design. The form will integrate with the existing Supabase authentication system and provide a polished user onboarding experience with proper validation, error handling, and responsive design.

## Goals

1. Create a pixel-perfect registration form matching the Figma design
2. Implement robust form validation with user-friendly error messages
3. Integrate seamlessly with existing Supabase authentication system
4. Provide responsive design that works across all device sizes
5. Ensure accessibility and performance standards are met

## User Stories

**As a new user**, I want to register for an account using a professional-looking form so that I feel confident about the application's quality.

**As a new user**, I want clear validation feedback so that I can correct any errors in my registration information immediately.

**As a new user**, I want to be redirected to the login page after successful registration so that I can sign in with my new credentials.

**As a returning user**, I want to easily navigate to the login page if I already have an account.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Route Setup**: Create `/register` page route in Next.js App Router
2. **Form Fields**: Include First Name, Last Name, Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password inputs
3. **Form Icons**: Add appropriate icons for each input field (user, email, password)
4. **Terms Checkbox**: Include "I agree to all terms" checkbox requirement
5. **Submit Button**: Styled "Register" button with coral/pink background (#FF9090)
6. **Navigation Link**: "Already have an account? Sign In" link redirecting to `/login`
7. **Form Validation**: 
   - Email format validation
   - Password strength (minimum 8 characters, special characters, numbers)
   - Password confirmation matching
   - Username uniqueness checking
   - Required field validation
8. **Error Display**: Show specific inline error messages below each field
9. **Loading States**: Display loading spinner/disabled state during form submission
10. **Success Handling**: Redirect to `/login` with success message after registration
11. **Error Handling**: Display specific error messages for registration failures
12. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive layout following standard breakpoints

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Email verification flow (handled by existing Supabase setup)
- Social login integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Multi-step registration wizard
- Profile picture upload during registration
- Custom terms and conditions page
- Password strength meter visualization
- Real-time username availability checking

## Design Considerations

**Visual Design:**
- Exact match to Figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/3Eu2OzDmojOosbVLku3A9m/To-do-List-Web-App-Design--Community-?node-id=449-1512&t=s4iHtQcGmo63bDKE-4
- White card container with subtle shadow
- Montserrat font family (700 weight for title, 500 for body text)
- Color palette: #FF9090 (button), #212427 (text), #999999 (placeholders)
- Background decorative pattern behind form card only
- Proper spacing and border radius matching design

**Component Structure:**
- `/app/register/page.tsx` - Main registration page
- `/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx` - Form component
- `/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components (Input, Button, etc.)

## Technical Considerations

**Form Management:**
- Use `react-hook-form` for form state management and validation
- Use `yup` for validation schema definition
- Implement proper TypeScript types for form data

**Styling:**
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling to match exact design specifications
- Import Montserrat font via Google Fonts or local assets
- Create custom Tailwind classes for design-specific colors

**API Integration:**
- Connect to existing `/api/auth/signup` endpoint
- Maintain existing user profile creation logic in Supabase
- Handle API errors with specific user-friendly messages

**Testing:**
- Unit tests with Vitest for form validation logic
- Integration tests with Playwright for complete registration flow
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes
