# AWSQDEMO-7: Login UI Design Implementation Specification

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a modern, visually appealing login interface based on the provided Figma design to replace the existing basic login form. The goal is to enhance user experience with improved visual design, proper iconography, comprehensive form validation, and responsive layout while maintaining existing Supabase authentication functionality.

## Goals

1. **Visual Enhancement**: Transform the basic login form into a modern, professional interface matching Figma specifications
2. **User Experience**: Improve usability with clear visual feedback, proper validation, and intuitive design
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal experience across mobile (320px+) and desktop (1024px+) devices
5. **Code Quality**: Follow existing component patterns and maintain TypeScript type safety

## User Stories

**As a returning user**, I want to see a visually appealing login form so that I feel confident about the application's quality and professionalism.

**As a user with accessibility needs**, I want proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support so that I can easily access the login functionality.

**As a mobile user**, I want the login form to work seamlessly on my device so that I can authenticate without usability issues.

**As a user making input errors**, I want clear validation feedback so that I can quickly correct mistakes and successfully log in.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Authentication
1. The system must authenticate users using existing Supabase Auth with email/password
2. The system must redirect authenticated users to the dashboard/home page
3. The system must handle authentication errors and display appropriate messages

### Form Fields & Validation
4. The system must provide a username/email input field with user icon
5. The system must provide a password input field with password icon and toggle visibility
6. The system must implement real-time validation for required fields
7. The system must validate email format for username field
8. The system must enforce password strength requirements (minimum 6 characters)
9. The system must display validation error messages below each field

### UI Components
10. The system must include a "Remember Me" checkbox (UI-only, no backend functionality)
11. The system must provide a coral/pink (#FF9090) login button
12. The system must display social login buttons for Google and Facebook (UI-only, non-functional)
13. The system must include a "Don't have an account? Create One" link to registration page

### Design Specifications
14. The system must use Montserrat font (700 weight for headings, 500 for body text)
15. The system must implement the exact color scheme: Background #FFFFFF, Text #212427, Placeholders #999999, Button #FF9090
16. The system must use 8px border radius for input fields and 5px for buttons
17. The system must include subtle shadow effects on the main container
18. The system must position icons 18px from left edge in input fields

### Responsive Design
19. The system must support mobile devices (320px minimum width)
20. The system must support desktop devices (1024px+ width)
21. The system must maintain proper spacing and proportions across breakpoints

### Accessibility
22. The system must include ARIA labels for all form elements
23. The system must support keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
24. The system must provide proper focus indicators
25. The system must maintain color contrast ratios for accessibility compliance

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Social Authentication**: Google and Facebook buttons are UI-only placeholders
- **Remember Me Functionality**: Checkbox is visual only, no extended session logic
- **Password Reset**: Not included in this implementation
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Not part of this redesign
- **Tablet-specific Breakpoints**: Only mobile and desktop responsive design
- **Advanced Password Validation**: Beyond basic length requirements
- **Login Analytics**: No tracking or metrics implementation

## Design Considerations

### Figma Design Reference
- **Design URL**: https://www.figma.com/design/I4M4qXKktnjcnbkL09NoOe/To-do-List-Web-App-Design--Community-?node-id=449-1513
- **Container Dimensions**: 1236x815px (desktop), responsive scaling for mobile
- **Form Container**: 559x438px with white background and shadow effects
- **Input Fields**: 559x60px with 8px border radius and #565454 border

### Component Structure
- Follow existing app component patterns in `/components/auth/`
- Create reusable input components for consistency
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for form data
- Use React Hook Form for form management and validation

### Visual Hierarchy
- "Sign In" heading: 36px, Montserrat 700
- Form labels and text: 16px, Montserrat 500
- Proper spacing between elements as per Figma measurements
- Consistent icon sizing (20x20px for user, 20x26.25px for password)

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Maintain existing Supabase Auth integration
- Use React Hook Form for form management
- Implement Yup schema validation
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling
- Add form icons to `/public/icons/` directory

### File Structure
- Update `/app/login/page.tsx` - Main login page component
- Create `/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - New login form component
- Update `/tailwind.config.js` - Add custom colors and Montserrat font
- Add icon assets to `/public/icons/` - user.svg, password.svg, eye.svg

### Integration Points
- Preserve existing Supabase client configuration
- Maintain current routing and middleware functionality
- Keep existing error handling patterns
- Follow established TypeScript type definitions

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize icon assets (SVG format recommended)
- Implement proper image loading for background elements
- Ensure minimal bundle size impact
- Use CSS-in-JS efficiently with Tailwind

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- **Visual Consistency**: 100% match with Figma design specifications
- **Responsive Functionality**: Proper display on mobile (320px+) and desktop (1024px+)

### Technical Metrics
- **Form Validation**: All validation rules working correctly
- **Authentication Flow**: Existing Supabase auth functionality preserved
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript compilation without errors
- **Performance**: No significant impact on page load times

### Functional Metrics
- **Error Handling**: Proper display of validation and authentication errors
- **Navigation**: Seamless flow between login and other pages
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Consistent experience across modern browsers
